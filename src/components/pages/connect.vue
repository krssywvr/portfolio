        <p>
            Thanks for stopping by! I'm Kristine, Software Engineer and lover of all things front-end. 
            The past few years I've been working exclusivly with Vue and as of late, I've been expanding my 
            skill set to include React and TypeScript. My favorite thing about software development is that you 
            are never done learning. When not stationed in front of my computer, I'm continuously trying to strike the perfect 
            balance between hitting the pliates studio and indulging in a tastey meal or cold cocktail. 
            Other hobbies include DIY projects, hiking, baking and photoshoots with my cat and dog.
